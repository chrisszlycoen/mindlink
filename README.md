# 🧠 MindLink — Reconnecting Humanity Through AI

**MindLink** is an AI-driven mental wellness platform that bridges the gap between emotional distress and timely support.  
It uses **AI emotional intelligence**, **real-time mood recognition**, and **personalized coping guidance** to empower people to understand, track, and improve their mental health — one thought at a time.

##  Vision
Our world is facing a silent epidemic — mental health crises, social isolation, and burnout.  
MindLink aims to **make emotional support accessible**, **personalized**, and **empathetic** through responsible AI.

We align with the following UN **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):**
- **SDG 3:** Good Health & Well-being  
- **SDG 4:** Quality Education (through emotional literacy tools)  
- **SDG 9:** Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure  
- **SDG 10:** Reduced Inequalities (AI for all, multilingual support)

##  How It Works

### AI Emotion Detection
Users interact with **MindLink AI**, a conversational assistant powered by emotion-sensitive large language models.  
It understands user sentiment from text or voice, identifies emotional tone, and responds with empathy.

### Personalized Support
The AI provides:
- Journaling prompts   
- Guided breathing or mindfulness sessions   
- Mood visualization dashboards   
- Suggestions for nearby therapists or counselors (optional API integration)   

### Secure and Private
All user data is encrypted and processed with privacy in mind — no cloud storage without consent.
